<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> <h2>My Journey into Development</h2>
 <h3> What motivated me to pursue a career in development was my father, who was a software engineer. I decided to follow this path to feel closer to him because, unfortunately, he passed away, leaving a lot of unfinished business between us. I am currently a developer in training, working toward specializing in full stack development, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and mobile development. The aspect I enjoy most about being a developer is the thrill of creating new things from scratch, bringing ideas to life through code.</h3></p>

<p> <h2>My Projects and Work</h2>
 <h3>All my projects will be linked to this website for you to view and explore. While I am still learning, each project represents my growing skills and dedication to development. I believe in continuous improvement, and this portfolio will serve as a showcase of my journey and the creative solutions I bring to each challenge.</h3></p>

<p> <h2>My Personal Interests and Future Goals</h2>
 <h3> Outside of development, I engage in graphic design, music production, and animation. These hobbies fuel my creativity and enhance my skills as a developer. Looking ahead, I hope to grow and scale my company by starting small and gradually expanding. One of my core beliefs is accessibility, so if you ever think you can't afford my services, rest assured that I am willing to work with you as long as youâ€™re willing to work with me.</h3></p>
